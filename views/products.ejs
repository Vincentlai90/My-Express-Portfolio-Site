                            In my role as the primary developer, I crafted a tailored website for a client operating in the workshop industry. Through close collaboration with the client, I conceptualized and built an attractive website that effectively presented their distinctive ceramic products and emphasized their range of workshop services. This website encompassed features such as an online gallery, a workshop schedule, and a contact form to facilitate inquiries.

                            I'm currently involved in a project known as 'You are Awesome,' which aims to enable individuals to create an application for hiring professionals to address their home-related issues. Through this application, customers will have direct access to the professionals who can guide and assist them in resolving problems via video conferences.
